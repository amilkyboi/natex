# natex

My LaTeX package.

## Installation

I use a system-wide installation of MiKTeX, so that's the installation process I'll be demonstrating. Navigate to `C:\Program Files\MiKTeX\tex\latex` and create a new folder named `natex`. Then just place the `.sty` file in there.

For non-system-wide MiKTeX installs, the TEXMF root directory is different. See [this page](https://miktex.org/kb/texmf-roots) for more details.

### Other Systems

For Linux, MacOS, etc. look [here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1137/where-do-i-place-my-own-sty-or-cls-files-to-make-them-available-to-all-my-te).
