# natex

A custom LaTeX package focused on consistent notation for engineering and physics applications.

## Installation

I use a system-wide installation of MiKTeX, so that's the installation process I'll be demonstrating. Create a new TEXMF root directory and add an appropriate TeX directory structure. The example I use is `C:\mytexmf\tex\latex\natex`. After placing the `.sty` file in the `natex` folder, open the MiKTeX admin console, go to the `Directories` tab under `Settings`, and add `C:\mytexmf` as a TEXMF root directory.

### Other Systems

For Linux, MacOS, etc. look [here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1137/where-do-i-place-my-own-sty-or-cls-files-to-make-them-available-to-all-my-te). See [this page](https://miktex.org/kb/texmf-roots) for more details on MiKTeX specific implementations.
